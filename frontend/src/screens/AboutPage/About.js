        The <b>Salaah Mentorship Program </b> is designed to provide support and
        guidance to young professionals as they navigate their careers. One key
        component of this program is the <b>Salaah Talent Evaluation Portal (STEP) </b>,
        which is used by mentors to assess applicants and identify the best
        prospects for interviews. This portal provides ongoing reports that
        track the progress of each group and offer a sense of competitiveness
        for students, helping them to refine and improve their resumes. 
        <br />The mentors who participate in the Salaah Mentorship Program play an
        essential role in helping students to achieve their goals. They bring a
        wealth of experience and knowledge to the table, and their ability to
        see what others cannot see is invaluable. They guide mentees through the
        process, providing insight and feedback that helps them to grow and
        develop as professionals. We are very grateful to all of the mentors who
        participate in the Salaah program, and we thank them for their time and
        dedication. <br />Our goal is to empower our 1200+ pupils to become
        well-rounded professionals with the necessary skills to land their first
        job, as a favour to their parents. We want to <b>repay the community of
        ABESEC </b> by transforming the lives of our students, and we believe that
        the guidance and support provided by mentors is critical to achieving
        this goal. With the help of our dedicated mentors, we are confident that
        our students will be able to achieve success in their careers.
